[package]
description=Community ID support for all native Zeek log files. This package is 
	a fork of Corelight's original zeek-community-id with the addition of 
	a collection of scripts to publish the community_id for a given connection
	to all releated zeek events.  This allows quick and easy correlation of 
	any Zeek log event with related alerts generated by Suricata and vice versa.
